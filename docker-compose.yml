# All containers created in single Docker Compose files automatically share the same network. No need to create a --network
# Container name newsapp-container is used as a host name by Apache2 instead of 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
# See <VirtualHost *:80> directive in my-httpd.conf
# You also use Docker Compose for a single container image if your image invocation is advanced, it may be easier to use
# a Docker compose file to deploy it, rather than relying on a specific docker run invocation
